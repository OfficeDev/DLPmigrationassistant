## Migrate non-renderable characters

There could be some keywords which may contain characters which do not render on many applications. These non-renderable or non-printable characters are often hidden in copy & pasted strings. 
To migrate keywords with these hidden characters follow these steps:
1. Copy the string with hidden characters from the migration assistant.
2. Paste it in a text editor or in this [online tool](https://www.soscisurvey.de/tools/view-chars.php) which will allow you to view the non-renderable characters.
3. Remove the hidden characters from the string.
4. Use this string to replace the one in the migration assistant.
