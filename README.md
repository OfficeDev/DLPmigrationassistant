The migration assistant tool takes you through a simple five-step migration process. It accepts Symantec DLP policy XML exports, performs mapping, and creates equivalent DLP policies through PowerShell scripts. 

You can safely use the migration assistant tool to create DLP policies in test mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with your production environment.
